# Just Hammers Changelog

## [20.1.5]

### Added

- Added a config to disable the no-breaking checks. This means, when enabled, hammers can break in the players inventory when their damage is depleted.
- Added a config option to disable the "fancy" durability in the tooltip as some other mods will already provide something similar.

### Fixed

- XP not dropping for ores and other blocks that drop XP
- Sound being played for all breaking blocks which caused sound engine issues
- Make netherite hammers fire resistant
